Simulation of a launch vehicle's journey to LEO

This is an attempt at creating a 6-DOF simulation for an orbital-class launch vehicle (aka rocket). This is the first time I am using GitHub (or any version control software for that matter). 

The file simulation.py will be the main file that should be ran in order to run the simulation.
